# Task 1: Convolutional Network evaluation on Image Classification

Image classification is one of the most recurrent problems on computer science. Particularly in the last few years, significant contributions have been made to solve this problem. On this project we will be using three models: AlexNet, ResNet-50 and ResNext-50 and comparing their performance using different metrics, all of this on the impresee-clothing dataset (reduced version).

All tests, source code and data manipulation are inside the `.ipynb` in this repo, it is also available in [Colab Notebook Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L3tFixxsyaqi6jXOAzC0h7GLXOlN0vug?usp=sharing)
